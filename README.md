# Rewards Reference Domain

## Purpose
The labs in this course teach key concepts in the context of a problem domain. The Reward Dining application provides a real-world context for applying the techniques you have learned to develop useful business applications.

This section provides an overview of the domain and the applications you will be working on within it.

## Domain Overview
The Domain is called Reward Dining. The idea is that customers can save money every time they eat at one of the restaurants participating in the network - a "Frequent Flyer" program for restaurants.

For example, Keith would like to save money for his children's education. Every time he dines at a restaurant participating in the network, a contribution is made to his account.

The account contribution (reward) will be shared by his two children Annabelle and Corgan. Thus Annabelle gets a fund to help her with her college fees.

## Reward Dining Domain Applications
This next section provides an overview of the applications in the Reward Dining domain that you will be working on in this course.

### The Rewards Application
The "rewards" application rewards an account for dining at a restaurant participating in the reward network. A reward takes the form of a monetary contribution to an account that is distributed among the account's beneficiaries. Here is how this application is used:

- When they are hungry, members dine at participating restaurants using their regular credit cards.
- Every two weeks, a file containing the dining credit card transactions made by members during that period is generated. A sample of one of these files is shown below:

the account with credit card 1234123412341234 is rewarded for a spending $100.00 at a restaurant with Merchant ID 1234567890 on 29th December 2010 (date is in North American date format).

The confirmed reward, number 9831, takes the form of an $8.00 account contribution distributed evenly among beneficiaries Annabelle and her brother Corgan.
